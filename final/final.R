##### PART IV : functions [20 pts]

# [6 pts]
# Write a function [firstColToNames] that takes a matrix or a data frame
# and converts the first column to row names.
# Input:  a matrix or a data frame
# Output : a matrix of data frame that is like the input except 
# -- the first column has been removed
# -- what was the first column is now row names.

# Example, make a small 2x4 matrix, test:
# test <- matrix(c(1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 5, 7, 9), ncol=4, byrow=T)
# > test
# [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
# [1,]    1    5    3    8
# [2,]    2    5    7    9
# The output from firstColToNames(test) should be a 2x3 matrix with row names
# > firstColToNames(test)

# 1    5    3    8
# 2    5    7    9

# [6 pts]
# Write a function [longerRange()] with
# Input [m1 and m2] : two numeric matrices or data frames, don't have to have the same dimension 
# Output : 1 if the range of m1 is larger than or equal to the range of m2, 
#        : 2 otherwise 
# The range is the distance between the maximum and minimum values
# The function should ignore NA values (i.e. if a matrix has an entry that is NA)

longerRange <- function(m1, m2){
  m1range <- max(m1, na.rm = TRUE) - min(m1, na.rm = TRUE) 
  m2range <- max(m2, na.rm = TRUE) - min(m2, na.rm = TRUE)

# [8 pts]
# Write a function [TempConv()] that takes
# Inputs
# [t] : a temperature (numeric value)
# [scale] : a character "F" or "C" depending on whether the 
#           input temperature is in Fahrenheit or Celcius
# Output 
# [t.new] : the temperature converted to the other scale.

# The conversion formulas are: 
# F = C * 9/5 + 32
# C = (F - 32) * 5/9
# so e.g. 30 F=-1.11 C and 30 C = 86 F

#WORKS WHEN SCALE IS ENTERED IN QUOTATION MARKS e.g. "F" OR "C"

##### PART V : simulations [10 pts]

# leave this here:
set.seed(123456)

# [5 pts]
# Write a function, [dice_sum()], that takes as input:
# [k] : the number of dice rolled
# [B] : the number of rolls
# and returns:
# [dsum] : a vector of length B where each element is the sum of a roll 
#          k dice 

# So if k=1 pick a number between 1 and 6 at random B times and return them,
# if k=2 then in each roll you pick twice a number between 1 and 6 at random,
# calculate their sum, do this B times and return
# and so on.

dice_sum <- function(k, B){
 thelist <- replicate(B, sum(sample(1:6, k)))

# [5 pts]
# Lets run four simulations:
# Fix k=2 for all simulations
# Use B=20, 100, 1000, 5000 (in this order)
 
# For each value of B we will:

# Calculate the mean and sd of the output and store in 
# [ave.diceRoll] : a vector of length 4 where each entry is the mean of the simulation output

# [sd.diceRoll] : a vector of length 4 where each entry is the sd of the simulation output

# Then plot four histograms of the output from dice_sum()
# On each histogram the x-axis label should be "sum of dice roll" and the title should be
# "Histogram for B=[correct number]"

# CAREFUL : just run 4 simulations and save the mean and sd each time and make the histogram
# DO NOT : run 4 simulations to get the mean, then another 4 simulations to make the plots.

# NOTE : if for some reason you can not write the function [dice_sum] create four vectors
# of length 20, 100, 1000 and 5000 and complete the tasks below.

#----------------------
# To get all four histograms on one plot we include a command that splits the plotting
# screen into four panels, 2 in each row.  When a plotting function is called the plot
# goes into the first panel (upper left), when you call a plotting function again it goes
# into the second panel (upper right), etc.

# DO NOT DELETE THIS:
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
