#   lost in the previous iteration of a simulation

# Your function should return the amount of your bet for the current iteration
# of a simulation. The bet must be between 0 and <current.wealth>.

# <init.wealth>: a numeric value giving starting wealth
# <prob.win>: a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the probability of winning
#   each round
# <max.turns>: an integer giving the maximum number of turns to be played
#
# Your function should return the difference between your initial and final
# wealth after playing a game for <max.turns> rounds. If your wealth falls below
# 0, the simulation should end.
