Brief Description of the Simulation: 

  I ran the simulation for two different grid sizes and for three different density values. Each simulation 
was replicated one hundred times in order to perform summary statistics on a larger group of data. In 
replication of the simulation, by default, the maximum number of steps taken was given to be ten thousand. 
I chose ten thousand steps because of the size of the grids, taking into consideration computing time. 

Results of a Set of Replications: 

  For running the following code: bml.repl(100, 10, 10, .32)
    A 10x10 grid with a density of .32. The resulting proportion of simulations that ended in gridlock of 
the 100 replications came out to be 0.There were no instances of gridlock and all simulations reached the 
end of the 10,000 steps. 

  For running the following code: bml.repl(100, 10, 10, .5)
    A 10x10 grid with a density of .5. The resulting proportion of siulations that ended in gridlock of the 
100 replications cam out to be .52. Summary stastics on the number of steps not taken by the simulations 
that ended in gridlock are listed here:

BML Simulations Questions: 

1. For what values of p, the density of the grid, did you ???nd free ???owing traffic and
traffic jams? Did you ???nd any cases of a mixture of jams and free ???owing traffic?
  
  From these simulations, and others, it seems as though a density of nearly .32 is where most grids greater 
than or equal to 10x10 begin to have incidences of gridlock. Densities below these values result in nearly if 
not all simulations of free flow termination. As the densities neared .5, more and more grids began to result 
in gridlock. At a density of .8 all grids resulted in gridlock. 

2. How many simulation steps did you need to run before observing this behavior?
  
  For the 10x10 grid with a density of .5, of the systems that ended in gridlock, they on average got 
through half of the maximum number of steps, roughly 5000 steps. Compared to the larger 20x20 grid with 
the same density, these systems on average only made it 70 steps. It would appear these density changes 
had a greater effect on the larger grid size. For the 10x10 grid of density .8, it took, on average, 16 
steps to reach gridlock. For the same setup on the 20x20 grid, it took 29 steps on average. 

3. Does the transition depend on the size or shape of the grid?

  I would conclude, yes. All other things constant, it would seem that changing the size of the grid, in 
this instance from 10x10 to 20x20 does indeed have an effect on the proportion of grids that result in 
gridlock. For the same desnity of .5, many more of the 10x10 grids ended in free flow than did the 20x20 
grids, a difference of .44.The smaller grid would appear to have an advantage over the larger grids for 
higher densities.
